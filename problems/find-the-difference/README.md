You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example 1:

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
<strong>Output:</strong> "e"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 'e' is the letter that was added.</code></pre>

### Example 2:

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> s = "", t = "y"
<strong>Output:</strong> "y"</code></pre>

### Constraints:

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
